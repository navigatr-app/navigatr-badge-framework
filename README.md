### What is a Digital Badge?

Digital badges are a visual representation of learning experiences.

They are issued or awarded by organisations to recognise achievements.

Individuals can share badges online to showcase their achievements that have been verified by the issuing organisation.

  

There are two sides of a digital badge.

**The badge visual** 
The focus when a recipient shares their badges on social media or share their collection of badges via their profile

**Badge metadata**
Information hosted on its own webpage with a description, criteria, skills tags - before it's issued it's called a badge class.

Once the badge is ‘issued’ to a recipient the information is updated to include their name, and details of when they received the badge (this is called a badge assertion).

Thousands of organisations use badges to recognise different types of achievements and learning, they are implemented to drive engagement, highlight skills, and provide data on learning outcomes.

  

### Why is a Framework needed?

With digital badges gaining traction around the world, and skills shortages growing, digital badges provide a way for skills to be recognised outside formalised qualifications.

  

During our work over the last 12 years consulting on digital badge strategies and creating them on behalf of organisations, we recognised a need for a common sense visual language to help people understand the kind of learning badges symbolise.

  

Our hope is that adoption of a framework that is evolving and collaborative will help us set a standard for what good quality badges look like, demystify digital badges and speed up adoption for the whole badging community and support the creation of learning pathways to help people see what the next step in their learning journey is, even if it’s not linear.

  
  

### About the Navigatr Badge Framework

The Digital Badge Framework is a versatile and user-friendly set of design templates for creating digital badges.

  

Our templates are designed to suit various types of learning and achievements, ensuring that badges are not only visually appealing but also meaningful and professional and saving hours of thinking when it comes to starting a new badge programme for your brand.

  

### Licence

All templates are provided for free under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) licence. Find out how to attribute here.

  

### Elements of the Navigatr Badge Framework

Our visual templates include the following fixed elements:

### Types

Types are signified by the shape of the badge in order to give learners and organisations a clear differentiator for different types of activities and help bring structure to their badge offerings.

![](https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdnTicKc616vLQ7G5QasJuTLQN74fjXBJsZJ-AGikieIksz36so9KRJYO_7RsfqV-WIITb0OvkeBKfXbcRwLzx7kRmXCF8YqbEsqa5oAl04yOOkODuQryhxAEUCLxxmXWTDpKx2mUHup_POqFYY9bG7XQDT?key=4MZYR2vn55nPABIbxJxUnA)

  
  

### Modes

Modes indicate the amount of effort required to earn the badge in a visual way. These are not levels, but can map to more formalised levels using the subtitle on the badge and fields in the badge information or metadata.

The mode is signified by the colour shading on the badge visual, which can be customised to the organisation's brand colour at Apply and Teach mode.

Lead mode is always full gradient and black.

Customisable elements include:

-   The title
    
-   The subtitle
    
-   The colour (at apply and teach mode)
    
-   The logo
    
-   The Border & Navigatr ident: 
This signifies if the badge has been quality assured by Navigatr. This could be customised to show quality assurance by another organisation.
    

  

## How to use the Framework

There are two ways to make use of the framework for your own badges.

1.  Create an organisation account on Navigatr (start a 14 day free trial here)[ and use our AI badge Assistant.
    

Badge Assistant will write the badge information based on a prompt about the experience or achievement you’re looking to recognise.

You’ll also receive a badge visual recommendation. The visual type and mode that best aligns with the Framework from the information in the prompt. You can then customise this choice with your own brand colours and logo or change the type and mode manually.

  

2.  Use this quiz to find the best badge template for your needs, download the file and edit the branding in a photo editing tool such as photoshop or a free alternative like GIMP, Pixlr or PixelMater.
