### Why Use This Framework?
- Ensure consistency and clarity in badge design
- Follow best practices for visual design and accessibility
- Easily customize templates to fit your needs

## Key Elements of Badge Design

A well-designed badge should communicate three essential elements:

1. **What the Badge Recognizes**: Ensure the badge clearly indicates the achievement or skill being recognized.
2. **Your Brand**: Incorporate your brand elements, such as logos and colors, consistently across all badges.
3. **Badge Hierarchy**: Demonstrate where your badge sits in relation to others in your collection using consistent design elements.

### Badge Visual Requirements
- Use a square canvas with a transparent background.
- Keep designs simple and bold for accessibility across various platforms.
- Ensure all text and symbols are legible, even at smaller sizes.

## Creating Your Badge

1. **Download a Template**: Start by downloading one of our badge templates available in the repository.
2. **Customize Your Badge**:
    - Add your logo, ensuring it’s consistently positioned.
    - Use your brand colors to make the badge visually aligned with your organization’s identity.
3. **Save and Export**:
    - Save the badge design in `.psd` format for future edits.
    - Export the final badge as a `.png` file for distribution.

## Quality Checks

Before publishing your badge, ensure it meets the following quality standards:
- **Accessibility**: Test the badge at various sizes to ensure legibility. Use high contrast colors and simple designs.
- **Consistency**: Verify that the branding, badge hierarchy, and design elements are uniform across all badges in your collection.
- **File Requirements**: Export your badge as a `.png` or `.webp` file, with dimensions ranging from 800x800 to 3000x3000 px and a maximum file size of 10 MB.
